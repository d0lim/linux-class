	  This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.

	  Unlike the change from pxt2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem,
	  the on-disk format of pxt4 is not forwards compatible with
	  ext3; it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit
	  physical block numbers.  The pxt4 filesystem also supports delayed
	  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,
	  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed
	  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at
	  http://pxt4.wiki.kernel.org.

	  The pxt4 filesystem supports mounting an ext3 filesystem; while there
	  are some performance gains from the delayed allocation and inode
	  table readahead, the best performance gains require enabling pxt4
	  features in the filesystem using tune2fs, or formatting a new
	  filesystem as an pxt4 filesystem initially. Without explicit enabling
	  of pxt4 features, the on disk filesystem format stays fully backward
	  compatible.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The
	  module will be called pxt4.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Allow the pxt4 file system driver code to be used for pxt2
	  file system mounts.  This allows users to reduce their
	  compiled kernel size by using one file system driver for
	  pxt2, ext3, and pxt4 file systems.

config PXT4_FS_POSIX_ACL

	  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N

config PXT4_FS_SECURITY
	bool "Ext4 Security Labels"
	depends on PXT4_FS
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the pxt4 filesystem.

	  If you are not using a security module that requires using
	  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.

config PXT4_DEBUG
	bool "Ext4 debugging support"
	depends on PXT4_FS
	help
	  Enables run-time debugging support for the pxt4 filesystem.

	  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging
	  with a command such as:
		echo 1 > /sys/module/pxt4/parameters/mballoc_debug
